## üê≥ Python with Node.js

#### FORKED FROM nikolaik/docker-python-nodejs

These images are build from `brandonbuttars/docker-python-nodejs` based on `nikolaik/docker-python-nodejs`. I use strict node versions and was using this in some pipelines and the updates broke my pipelines so I forked the project and took out all the automation so I could manage the versions I was interested in and prevent any future fragility.

If you're OK using the latest, use [https://hub.docker.com/r/nikolaik/python-nodejs](https://hub.docker.com/r/nikolaik/python-nodejs) and there a ton of different tags and versions you can choose from. I just needed to customize and thin out that list a bit and make sure I kept stability in my pipelines.

The `latest` tag is currently:

- Node: 16.13.0
- npm: 8.x
- yarn: latest
- Python: 3.7.12
- pip: latest
- pipenv: latest
- poetry: latest

## üè∑ Tags

To use a specific combination of Python and Node.js see the following table of available image tags.

## Typical tasks

```bash
# Pull from Docker Hub
docker pull brandonbuttars/python-nodejs:latest
# Build from GitHub
docker build -t brandonbuttars/python-nodejs github.com/brandonbuttars/docker-python-nodejs
# Run image
docker run -it brandonbuttars/python-nodejs bash
```

| Tag      | Python | Node.js | Distro |
| -------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `buster` | 3.7.12 | 16.13.0 | buster |
| `slim`   | 3.7.12 | 16.13.0 | slim   |
